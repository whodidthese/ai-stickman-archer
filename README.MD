# AI Stickman Archer

[![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

A simple HTML5 mobile browser game prototype where you control a stickman archer trying to hit an apple on a stump.

**This project is entirely generated by Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, including this README.MD file.**

## Key Features

* **Mobile-First Design:** Optimized for portrait mode on mobile browsers.
* **Touch Controls:** Drag to aim and set power; release to shoot. Cancel shot by releasing near the starting point.
* **Physics-Based Arrow:** Arrow follows a parabolic trajectory influenced by gravity and wind.
* **Progressive Difficulty:**
    * Target distance increases (capped to stay on screen).
    * Stump height varies randomly each round.
    * Wind is introduced and increases in strength/changes direction.
* **Wind Compensation:** Visual wind indicator shows direction and strength, but the trajectory preview line *does not* account for wind, requiring manual compensation.
* **Scoring & Lives:** Score points for hitting the apple. Game ends after 3 misses.
* **Leaderboard:** Top 10 scores saved locally using Local Storage.
* **Modular Code:** JavaScript codebase organized into separate files for better readability and maintenance.
* **Cute Visuals:** Features a pink color scheme and simple, stylized graphics.

## How to Play

1.  **Open the Game:** Launch the `client/index.html` file in a modern web browser (mobile preferred, or use desktop browser's mobile simulation).
2.  **Aim:** Touch and drag anywhere on the screen. A yellow circle marks your starting point, and a line indicates the angle and power of your shot.
3.  **Check Preview & Wind:** A dotted line shows the arrow's predicted path *without* wind. Look at the wind indicator at the top (e.g., `Wind: >> 5`) to see the wind's direction and strength.
4.  **Shoot:** Release your touch **outside** the yellow starting circle to fire the arrow. Remember to adjust your aim to compensate for the wind!
5.  **Cancel Shot:** Release your touch **inside** the yellow starting circle to cancel the current aim and try again.
6.  **Score:** Hit the pink apple on the stump to score 1 point. The target will then move, and the stump height may change.
7.  **Miss:** Hitting the stump, the ground, or shooting off-screen uses one of your 3 arrows.
8.  **Game Over:** The game ends when you run out of arrows. Your final score is displayed along with the leaderboard.
9.  **Restart:** Click the "Play Again" button on the game over screen.
